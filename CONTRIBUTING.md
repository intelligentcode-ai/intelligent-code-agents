### Expected Behavior
- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

### Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, discrimination, or offensive comments

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in many forms:

### Reporting Bugs
- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Use the issue template when available
- Include clear reproduction steps
- Provide system information (OS, version, etc.)
- Include relevant error messages and logs

### Suggesting Features
- Check if the feature has already been suggested
- Clearly describe the problem it solves
- Provide use cases and examples
- Consider implementation complexity

### Improving Documentation
- Fix typos and clarify confusing sections
- Add examples for complex features
- Update outdated information
- Translate documentation (coordinate first)

### Contributing Code
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `dev` (`feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/your-fix-name`)
3. Make your changes following our standards
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request to the `dev` branch

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure
- **`main`** - Stable release branch (protected, releases only)
- **`dev`** - Main development branch (protected, requires PRs)
- **`feature/*`** - New features (branched from `dev`, merged to `dev`)
- **`fix/*`** - Bug fixes (branched from `dev`, merged to `dev`)

### Workflow
1. **Start work**: Branch from `dev` → `feature/your-feature` or `fix/your-bug`
2. **Develop**: Make changes, commit frequently
3. **Pull Request**: Create PR targeting `dev` branch
4. **Review**: PR review (approval optional, but encouraged)
5. **Merge**: Squash and merge to `dev`
6. **Release**: Periodic releases from `dev` → `main`

### Branch Protection
- **`dev`**: Requires pull requests (no direct commits), no approval required
- **`main`**: Protected, releases only via tagged PRs from `dev`
