# Roles, Agents, and Subagents (v10.2)

Terminology can be confusing because different tools use different words.

## What ICA Ships

ICA primarily ships **Skills**:
- source of truth: `src/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- installed to: `~/.claude/skills/` (and optionally project `.claude/skills/`)

Role names like `@PM` or `@Reviewer` are **role skills** with well-defined responsibilities.

## How “Agents” Happen

- In **Claude Code**, the UI/runtime can run specialized subagents. ICA’s role skills are designed to be invoked with
  role mentions like `@PM ...` or `@Reviewer ...`.
- In other tools, you can still use the same intent in plain language (skills are loaded by description matching).
