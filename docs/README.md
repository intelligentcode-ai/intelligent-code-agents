# Documentation

See [index.md](index.md) for the small, curated navigation of the docs. The index links the core guides (install, configure, operate, troubleshoot) without the noise.

Note: Any place the docs say `make install`, you can use `make clean-install` for a full reset (force uninstall + reinstall) on macOS/Linux.
