# Virtual Team Guide (v10.2)

ICA turns a single agent session into a **role-based virtual team** via Skills.

## Core Idea

- You describe work in plain language.
- ICA routes the request to the right skill(s) and role(s).
- Work is tracked in `.agent/queue/` for cross-platform persistence.

## How To Involve Roles

If your client supports it (Claude Code), use role mentions:

```text
@PM break down this story into work items
@Architect review the design
@Developer implement the change
@Reviewer check for regressions
```

If your client does not support `@Role`, use plain language:

```text
As PM: break this story into .agent/queue work items
As Reviewer: do a post-PR Stage 3 review and post an ICA-REVIEW-RECEIPT
```

## The 14 Core Roles

Leadership and planning:
- `@PM`: breakdown, sequencing, dependency management (does not implement)
- `@Architect`: design, tradeoffs, consistency checks

Implementation and operations:
- `@Developer`, `@System-Engineer`, `@DevOps-Engineer`, `@Database-Engineer`

Quality and risk:
- `@QA-Engineer`, `@Backend-Tester`, `@User-Role`, `@Security-Engineer`, `@Reviewer`

Product and UX:
- `@Requirements-Engineer`, `@Web-Designer`, `@AI-Engineer`

## Dynamic Specialists

When a specific domain is needed, you can request it directly:

```text
@React-Developer implement the UI
@Kubernetes-Engineer review the deployment approach
@Postgres-Engineer tune this query plan
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. Start with `@PM` to break work into `.agent/queue/` items (especially for medium+ tasks).
2. Implement with the appropriate role.
3. Run `@Reviewer` (or the `reviewer` skill) before committing / opening a PR.
4. For PRs, require an `ICA-REVIEW-RECEIPT` (Stage 3, temp checkout) as the review gate.

See `docs/workflow-guide.md` for details.
