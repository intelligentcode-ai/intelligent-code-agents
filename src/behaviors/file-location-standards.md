# File Location Standards (Minimal)

**MANDATORY:** Write files only in their correct directories.

## Mapping
- **Summaries/Reports** → `summaries/`
- **Stories/Epics** → `stories/`
- **Bugs** → `bugs/`
- **Memory** → `memory/`
- **Docs** → `docs/`

## Rules
- Never place summaries/reports in `docs/` or project root
- Respect `paths.*` overrides from config
