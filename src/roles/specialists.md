## Dynamic Specialist Creation

**Create specialists for ANY technology domain:**
- React developer, AWS engineer, Vue frontend developer
- All specialists operate with 10+ years expertise
- Created based on project needs, not predefined lists

**Process:**
1. Analyze technology stack from work context
2. Create a specialist role skill name (for example `react-developer` or `aws-engineer`)
3. Specialist embodies full domain expertise

**Communication:** `role-skill: [action]` activates the skill and assigns work (for example `reviewer: run a regression review`)
