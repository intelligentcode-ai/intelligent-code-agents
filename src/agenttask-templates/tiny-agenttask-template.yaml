execution_notes: |
  CRITICAL: MANDATORY git_privacy validation BEFORE ALL git operations:
  1. Load git_privacy setting from configuration (NEVER assume)
  2. When git_privacy=true, strip ALL AI mentions from:
     - Commit messages (remove "AI", "Claude", "agent", "Generated with Claude Code", etc.)
     - PR descriptions and titles
     - Release notes and changelogs
     - Any git-visible text including co-author attributions
  3. Use clean, professional language in all git operations
  4. Block git operations if privacy setting not validated

## STEP 1: KNOWLEDGE
knowledge_search:
  memory_search: "Search memory/[topic]/ for implementation patterns"
  best_practices: "Review best-practices/[domain]/ for guidance"

## STEP 2: IMPLEMENTATION
implementation:
  target_file: "[FILE_PATH]"
  changes_needed:
    - "[CHANGE_1]"
    - "[CHANGE_2]"
  validation: "[HOW_TO_TEST]"

## STEP 3: REVIEW
review_checklist:
  - "Functional requirements met"
  - "Code follows project patterns"
  - "No unintended side effects"

## STEP 4: VERSION
version_bump:
  type: "patch"
  action: "Bump version number appropriately"

## STEP 5: DOCUMENTATION
documentation:
  changelog:
    entry: "### Added/Fixed\n- [FEATURE_DESCRIPTION]"
    required: true
  additional: "Update any affected docs as needed"
  comments: "Add inline comments for complex logic"

## STEP 6: GIT COMMIT
git_commit:
  commit_message: "[ID]: [DESCRIPTION]"
  privacy_filter: "[FROM_CONFIG]"
  action: "Commit changes with clean message (no AI mentions)"

## STEP 7: GIT PUSH
git_push:
  action: "Push to remote repository"
