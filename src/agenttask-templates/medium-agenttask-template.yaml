# ========================================
# EXECUTION PROCESS: 9 CLEAR STEPS
# ========================================

execution_notes: |
  CRITICAL: MANDATORY git_privacy validation BEFORE ALL git operations:
  1. Load git_privacy setting from configuration (NEVER assume)
  2. When git_privacy=true, strip ALL AI mentions from:
     - Commit messages (remove "AI", "Claude", "agent", "Generated with Claude Code", etc.)
     - PR descriptions and titles
     - Release notes and changelogs
     - Any git-visible text including co-author attributions
  3. Use clean, professional language in all git operations
  4. Block git operations if privacy setting not validated

## STEP 1: GIT BRANCH
branch_creation:
  branch_name: "[FROM_CONFIG_PREFIX]/[ID]-[DESCRIPTION]"
  actions:
    - "Create feature branch from default branch"
    - "Switch to feature branch"

## STEP 2: KNOWLEDGE
knowledge_search:
  memory_search: "Search memory/[topic]/ for feature patterns"
  best_practices: "Review best-practices/[domain]/ for guidance"
  patterns: "[TOP_RELEVANT_PATTERNS]"

## STEP 3: IMPLEMENTATION
implementation:
  files_to_modify:
    - path: "[FILE_1]"
      changes: "[CHANGES_DESCRIPTION_1]"
    - path: "[FILE_2]"
      changes: "[CHANGES_DESCRIPTION_2]"
  validation: "[TESTING_STRATEGY]"

## STEP 4: REVIEW
review_checklist:
  - "Multi-file coordination"
  - "Feature completeness"
  - "Code quality and patterns"
  - "Configuration compliance"

## STEP 5: VERSION
version_bump:
  type: "patch/minor"
  action: "Bump version number appropriately"

## STEP 6: DOCUMENTATION
documentation:
  changelog:
    entry: "### Added\n- [FEATURE_DESCRIPTION]"
    required: true
  readme_updates: "Update README/API docs/guides as needed"
  comments: "Document complex logic and integrations"

## STEP 7: GIT COMMIT
git_commit:
  commit_message: "[ID]: [DESCRIPTION]"
  privacy_filter: "[FROM_CONFIG]"
  action: "Commit all changes with clean message (no AI mentions)"

## STEP 8: GIT PUSH
git_push:
  action: "Push feature branch to remote"

## STEP 9: GIT PR
pull_request:
  title: "[ID]: [FEATURE_DESCRIPTION]"
  description: |
